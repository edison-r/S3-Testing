# 🎬 SPRINT 3 - JavaScript Array Methods Practice

This project contains **JavaScript exercises** focused on practicing **array methods**, **logic building**, and **data manipulation** using a movies dataset.  
It was developed as part of my learning journey to gain fluency with methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.sort()`, and `.find()`.

---
## Technologies Used

- JavaScript ES6+
- Jest (for testing certain exercises)

---
## Concepts Practiced

- Creating reusable functions to manipulate arrays of objects
- Transforming and filtering datasets
- Sorting with custom logic
- Aggregating data using `.reduce()`
- Safely copying and mutating objects with spread operators
- Using `.includes()` and `.join()` with arrays
- Writing clean, modular code
- Using jest for testing

## Project Structure

```
📁 src
   ├── data.js         ← array with all the movies details
   ├── films.js        ← logic functions (those functions are the one passing the tests)
   └── index.html      ← simple HTML

📁 tests
   └── films.spec.js   ← tests to pass
      
.gitignore
package.json          ← some configuration
test-results.html     ← HTML generated by jest to see the tests 
README.md             ← this file
```

## My Dev Journal

Here we go again! More JavaScript practicing! 💪🏻

This project was a deep dive into solving problems, debugging, and learning how small changes in logic can hugely affect the outcome.

As usual, at the beginning some things felt strange. But with repetition, it all started to make sense. I asked my mentor for more exercises to keep practicing and improving my logic skills.

One line at a time! 👨🏽‍💻
